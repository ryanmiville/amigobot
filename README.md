# Contributing
This project uses dep for dependency management. If you need to add a new dependency, [here](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html) are instructions for installing it. Reference [the docs](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html#adding-a-new-dependency) for how to add dependencies. The current dependencies are packaged with the repo in the [vendor](https://github.com/ryanmiville/amigobot/tree/master/vendor) directory.


Download the repo with `go get github.com/ryanmiville/amigobot`

## To Add A New Command...
1. Create a new package
2. Implement the `Handler` interface found [here](handler.go).
3. Write a companion test for your new `Handler`
3. Add an instance of your `Handler` implementation to the `handlers` array in [main.go](cmd/amigobot/main.go)

See [greet.go](greet/greet.go) as a very simple example.

## Tests
run all tests with `go test ./...` to verify you haven't broken any command. Again follow the [greet example](greet/greet_test.go) to see how to mock the use of a real discord session.

## Running Locally
In the `.../amigobot/cmd/amigobot` directory, run `go install`

Now you should be able to run the app with `amigobot -t [your-bot-token]`
